                            to increase our competitiveness.

                            growth, and tap into our high-performing sectors.`,
  energyDescription: `Energy lies at the very heart of our development
                            strategy, and all our investments in this sector
                            improve our people’s lives and livelihoods.

                            Hydropower is energy obtained from flowing water. <br/>
                            One of the first sources of energy used for
                            electricity generation, it is also considered one
                            of the most cost-effective. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            Guinea has more than half of West Africa’s principal
                            rivers. Since 2010, we have built new dams, <br/> rehabilitated
                            and expanded our power grid, and increased energy
                            collaboration with our neighbors.`,
  tourismDescription: `The vast potential of tourism is still being realized.   
                        We are investing in our rich cultural heritage, and in
                        the unspoilt beauty of our well-preserved landscapes.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Yet to be explored by the world, Guinea offers 
                        rare experiences to adventurous travelers, and we
                        are gearing up to welcome them in great numbers.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Since 2010, we have improved our road infrastructure
                        for quicker and easier travel, increased hotel offerings
                        by 40%, and created thousands of new jobs in the 
                        hospitality sector.`,
  infrastructureDescription: `Infrastructure is the cornerstone of our economic growth,
                        and supports all sectors of Guinean industry and activity.
                        We are determined to convert earlier weaknesses into
                        key strengths, and create a sustainable future. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        Since 2010, we have invested heavily in infrastructure,
                        building and rehabilitating our roads, airports, and ports.
                        We are facilitating quicker transport of people and goods 
                        and also improving living standards.
                        <br/><br/>
                        We are mindful of protecting those in need, with new 
                        social housing programs, health facilities, and schools
                        across the country.`,
  agricultureDescription: `With over 13 million ha of arable land, a diverse climate,
                    1,160 waterways and rainfalls averaging 120-430 cm,
                    Guinea has the potential to be an agricultural powerhouse.
                    For too long, less than 10% of cultivable land was exploited
                    despite 85% of the population working in agriculture
                     <br/> <br/> 
                    Since 2010, we have massively invested to modernize
                    the sector through capacity-building of farmers, subsidizing
                    farming inputs and supplying modern machinery. We are
                    undergoing a shift from small-scale subsistence farming to
                    mass production, resulting in higher crop yields and exports.
                    <br/> <br/> 
                    This contributes to making Guinea a regional agribusiness hub.
